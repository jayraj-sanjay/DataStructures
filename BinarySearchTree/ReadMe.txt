Used an existing Binary Search Tree data structure named BinarySearchTree.java from Mark Allen Weiss - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java 3rd Edition.

Added some additional functions:
1)nodeCount : Recursively traverses the tree and returns the count of nodes.

2)isFull : Returns true if the tree is full.  A full tree has every node as either a leaf or a parent with two children.
 
3)compareStructure : Compares the structure of current tree to another tree and returns true if they match.

4)equals : Compares the current tree to another tree and returns true if they are identical.

5) copy : Creates and returns a new tree that is a copy of the original tree.

6)mirror : Creates and returns a new tree that is a mirror image of the original tree.

7)isMirror : Returns true if the tree is a mirror of the passed tree.

8)rotateRight : Performs a single rotation on the node having the passed value.

9)rotateLeft : As above but left rotation.

10)printLevels : Performs a level-by-level printing of the tree.



All these above functions were tested in the main method of the class.
