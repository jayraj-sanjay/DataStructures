Used an existing Hash Table data structure named QuadraticProbingHashTable.java from Mark Allen Weiss - Data Structures and Algorithm Analysis in Java 3rd Edition.

Created a word puzzle game where the user enters the number of rows and columns the grid should have.
The program randomly generates a grid of letters.
We search for words in the grid from a loaded dictionary of words file.

The words in the puzzle grid are searched:
->Horizontally and reverse
->Vertically and reverse
->Diagonally and reverse

The user has an option to select a standard algorithm or an optimized algorithm. 

In the optimized algorithm if the prefix of the word is not in the dictionary the execution is stopped and a new word formation is started. 
The time taken by each of the algorithms is also visible.
