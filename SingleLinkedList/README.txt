Created a single linked list with basic functions:

1)addFront -Adds an element to the front of the list
2)addBack - Adds an element to the back of the list
3)removeFront - Removes an element from the front of the list
4)removeBack - Removes an element from the back of the list
5)get - Returns an element at an index
6)reverse - reverses the list

In the main function most of these operations are tested and the output is printed.
